## 1. Introduction
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes the following functions and quality requirements of the App MemeVZ in more detail.

### 1.1 Purpose
This SRS describes all specifications for "memeVZ". MemeVZ is a tribute to the popular SchülerVZ which was discontinued in 2013. It is a newer version for the younger generation to exchange ideas in a slightly different way. With MemeVZ we want to provide a new platform for viewing and sharing memes with people all over the world. Our goal is to reach the unreached with good qualtity content to laugh at. Everyone knows that a little laughter can cure anything.
“Find people that have the same kind of humor as you and you will never be alone” we say. To achieve all this we hold on to our Slogan: “Humor for humanity”.
In this document the usage of MemeVZ will be explained. Furthermore reliability, reaction speed and other important characteristics of this project will be specified. This includes design and architectural decisions regarding optimization of these criteria as well.

### 1.2     Scope
This software specification applies to the whole "MemeVZ" application. As already explained, MemeVZ is a tribute to the popular SchülerVZ which was discontinued in 2013. Share and display your favorite memes with a DH-wide community. Show what your humor is all about and make everyday life at dh a little bit funnier and amusing.

## 3.                  Specific Requirements
tbd
[This section of the SRS should contain all the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.   When using use-case modeling, these requirements are captured in the Use-Cases and the applicable supplementary specifications.  If use-case modeling is not used, the outline for supplementary specifications may be inserted directly into this section, as shown below.]

### 3.1     Functionality
tbd
[This section describes the functional requirements of the system for those requirements which are expressed in the natural language style. For many applications, this may constitute the bulk of the SRS Package and thought should be given to the organization of this section. This section is typically organized by feature, but alternative organization methods may also be appropriate, for example, organization by user or organization by subsystem.  Functional requirements may include feature sets, capabilities, and security.

Where application development tools, such as requirements tools, modeling tools, etc., are employed to capture the functionality, this section document will refer to the availability of that data, indicating the location and name of the tool that is used to capture the data.]

#### 3.1.1     Functional Requirement One
tbd
[The requirement description.]

### 3.2               Usability
tbd
[This section should include all of those requirements that affect usability. For example,

•               specify the required training time for a normal users and a power user to become productive at particular operations

•               specify measurable task times for typical tasks or base the new system’s usability requirements on other systems that the users know and like

•               specify requirement to conform to common usability standards, such as IBM’s CUA standards Microsoft’s GUI standards]

#### 3.2.1          Usability Requirement One
tbd
[The requirement description goes here.]

### 3.3     Reliability
tbd
[Requirements for reliability of the system should be specified here. Some suggestions follow:

•               Availability—specify the percentage of time available ( xx.xx%), hours of use, maintenance access, degraded mode operations, etc.

•               Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) — this is usually specified in hours, but it could also be specified in terms of days, months or years.

•               Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)—how long is the system allowed to be out of operation after it has failed?

•               Accuracy—specify precision (resolution) and accuracy (by some known standard) that is required in the system’s output.

•               Maximum Bugs or Defect Rate—usually expressed in terms of bugs per thousand of lines of code (bugs/KLOC) or bugs per function-point( bugs/function-point).

•               Bugs or Defect Rate—categorized in terms of minor, significant, and critical bugs: the requirement(s) must define what is meant by a “critical” bug; for example, complete loss of data or a complete inability to use certain parts of the system’s functionality.]

#### 3.3.1          <Reliability Requirement One>
tbd
[The requirement description.]

### 3.4     Performance
tbd
[The system’s performance characteristics should be outlined in this section. Include specific response times. Where applicable, reference related Use Cases by name.

•               response time for a transaction (average, maximum)

•               throughput, for example, transactions per second

•               capacity, for example, the number of customers or transactions the system can accommodate

•               degradation modes (what is the acceptable mode of operation when the system has been degraded in some manner)

•               resource utilization, such as memory, disk, communications, etc.

#### 3.4.1          <Performance Requirement One>
tbd
[The requirement description goes here.]

tbd
[The requirement description goes here.]

### 3.6     Design Constraints
tbd
[This section should indicate any design constraints on the system being built. Design constraints represent design decisions that have been mandated and must be adhered to.  Examples include software languages, software process requirements, prescribed use of developmental tools, architectural and design constraints, purchased components, class libraries, etc.]

#### 3.6.1          <Design Constraint One>
tbd
[The requirement description goes here.]

### 3.8     Purchased Components
tbd
[This section describes any purchased components to be used with the system, any applicable licensing or usage restrictions, and any associated compatibility and interoperability or interface standards.]

### 3.9     Interfaces
tbd
[This section defines the interfaces that must be supported by the application. It should contain adequate specificity, protocols, ports and logical addresses, etc. so that the software can be developed and verified against the interface requirements.]

#### 3.9.1          User Interfaces
tbd
[Describe the user interfaces that are to be implemented by the software.]

#### 3.9.2          Hardware Interfaces
tbd
